Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus.", "There fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any where else in the world. In Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you because you have married Helen, and are", "Penelope's son has gone off on board of a ship. I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest something should happen to him. He has many enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.", "The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses. The Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it.", "The Cyclopes neither plant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage. Their wild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains.", "\u201cI wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more than Neptune to cure that eye of yours\u2019 \u201cOn this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, \u2018Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true", "\u201cWhen they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner. \u201cTheir hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre Polyphemus.

He said: \u201cIf I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me.\u201d As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and", "Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope, \u201cWife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though I was longing all the time to do so.
