Very likely... I don't know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Vronsky sat down without once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him. \u201cKonstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople,\u201d said Countess Nordston. Vronsky got up and, looking cordially, shook hands with Levin.", "\u201cAfter dinner there\u2019s no credit in them? Well, then, I\u2019ll make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready,\u201d said the baroness, sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot. \u201cWe\u2019ve been marrying you here. Have you brought your wife?\u201d", "The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the princess heard his tone she subsided at once. \u201cAlexander, Alexander,\u201d she whispered, moving to him and beginning to weep. As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down.", "Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband\u2019s infidelity had cut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her. Dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out. She felt certain that her surmises were correct.", "Pava's daughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling. Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him. The hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart-horses\u2019 stable, only meant for feeding calves.", "Levin saw the bird flying straight towards him; the guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded close to his ear. There was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped like an arrow, and darted upwards again.", "\u201cYou choose what we\u2019re to drink,\u2019 he said, handing him the card, and looking at him. \u201cRhine wine, please,\u201d said the young officer, stealing a timid glance at Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache.", "Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again. The umpire who was starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper. At last for the fourth time he shouted \u201cAway!\u201d and the racers started.", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be tried. I shan\u2019t murder anybody, and I\u2019ve no need of it. Well, I tell you what,\u201d he went on, flying off again to a subject quite beside the point. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day, for", "\u201cNo honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman. I always knew it and always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cI made a mistake in linking my life to hers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy. It\u2019s not I that", "\"I don\u2019t understand him in the least,\u201d said Vronsky. \u201cHow can he put up with such a position? He feels it, that\u2019s evident.\u201d \u201cWhat are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?\u201d", "Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, which controlled his life. He felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood, and that something was expected of him. Above all, he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.", "Anna thought: \u201cI have inevitably made that man wretched,\u201d she thought; \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to profit by his misery.\u201d But, however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer, she was not suffering. Separation from the son she loved\u2014even that did not cause her anguish in these early days.", "Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were, hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better. Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them.", "Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before. Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love.", "Levin and Dolly heard the sound of horses and wheels on the gravel. Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him. But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince.", "Anna was indignant against him and found grounds for indignation in everything. For everything that was difficult in her position she blamed him. If he had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position, and would have rescued her from it. For her being in Moscow and not in the country, he was to blame too.", "The author had a recurring nightmare about a man bending over an iron. She felt that the man was doing something horrible with the iron over her. When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist.", "She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her. A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories.", "\u201cIt was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,\u201d he said to Levin. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to a long while. Now we shall have some discussion, we\u2019ll see to that. Have you been reading Spencer?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest"]}
