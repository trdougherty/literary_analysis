He is best known for his novel \"The Death and Life of Ivan the Terrible\" In the book, he tells of the death of his wife, and how he tried to find a solution.", "Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne. They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes. It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life.", "Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her. \u201cOh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most loathsome light,\u201d she went on.", "\u201cNo,\u201d answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, \u201cno, let\u2019s have that one.\u201d And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as well as the others. When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.", "\u201cSo you will send me that book, dear count? I\u2019m very grateful to you,\u201d she said to the young Swede. \u201cThat\u2019s our aristocracy, prince!\u201d the Moscow colonel said with ironical intention.", "\u201cAll I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it.\u201d \u201cI am awfully, awfully sorry for her. You suffer only from pride,\u201d said Darya Alexandrovna.", "\u201cYes, time will pass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be reestablished,\u201d Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself. She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to blame, and so I cannot be unhappy.\u201d", "\u201cYou know in decent society one doesn\u2019t talk or think even of certain details of the toilet. That\u2019s how it is with this. But anything more than that in reality, no one cares to inquire.\u201d \u201cI understand you, and I understand Liza. Liza now is one of those na\u00efve natures that, like children, don", "\u201cWasn\u2019t it awful?\u201d she said, looking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul. \u201cYes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,\u201d said Anna, blushing.", "In the middle of the old man\u2019s account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates creaked again, and laborers came into the yard from the fields. The laborers were obviously of the household: two were young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts. \u201cWhat have they been ploughing?\ufffd", "Levin felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness, definiteness, and good courage in life.", "Levin tried through her to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind. But he had not complete freedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of embarrassment.", "They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and offering their services. Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys'.", "\u201cWell, God help you!\u201d said Betsy. \u201cI think you\u2019re giving way to pessimism. You must rouse yourself, you must look life in the face. But the chief thing was having to settle this.\u201d", "\u201cMother, darling, sweet one!\u201d he shouted, flinging himself on her again and hugging her. \u201cI don\u2019t want that on,\u2019 he said, taking off her hat. And as it were, seeing her afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing her again.\u201d \u201cBut what did you think about me?", "\u201cOh, here is he!\u201d she said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery. \u201cBut where is he? How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?\u2019 she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach.", "\u201cNo, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied\u2014at least I could not. The great thing for me is to feel that I\u2019m not to blame.\u201d \u201cWe shan\u2019t go to sleep, you know. Come, let\u2019s go!\u201d Levin did not answer.", "Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them together from the farm and saddle-horses. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to wound me, you\u2019ll take mine.\u201d", "Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya Alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I always loved you, and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as one would like", "Kitty asked Levin what he was going to do in the morning. He said he was only going to Katavasov to talk to him about his work. She asked him if he would like to go to the concert with her. Levin said he would certainly go.", "Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read. Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science.", "\u201cBut how could he go away, leaving me in such a state? How can he live, without making it up with me?\u201d She went to the window and began looking into the street. \u201cWhy, then, he has never received it!\u201d she thought.", "\u201cYou know Count Vronsky, the notorious one... is going by this train?\u201d said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he found her again and gave her the letter. \u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining-room. They went forward too, and heard", "\u201cThat word \u2018people\u2019 is so vague,\u201d said Levin. \u201cParish clerks, teachers, and one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it\u2019s all about. The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, haven\u2019t the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about"]}
